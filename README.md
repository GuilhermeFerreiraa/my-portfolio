## Dark Mode
The dark theme mode can be changed, just click on the moon icon and the entire landing page will be dark, after clicking on the sun icon, the site goes back to the default theme.

## My experience in website development:

When I started, I glimpsed the end of the site, what the responsive mode would be like, what her style would be, what images to use, among other things. And as the project developed, I realized it would be better than I could have imagined. I am very happy with the result and of course I will take this experience to the next projects.
